     <h4>Analysis</h4>
     <p>
         This page following the rule of thirds very well. The rule of thirds is place images or contents
         on 1/3 on page. The top page is obious which images are exactly divided in 3 sections.
         In this way, image looks very focus and easy to tell the message what the company wants to tell.

        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Walmart page is good at white space and clean design. Shopping site tends to use too many colors or images.
            However, this site using enough white space so that it looks simple and clear to understand each sections.

        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Make different color to make stand out is the way of make contrast. Good thing about this page is on the top has a image which has a color.
            On the bottom has imanges like icons which is black and white. It has good contrast to know that they are different topic and
            black and white make very clear to understand especially when there are some othe colors.
